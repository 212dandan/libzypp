/** \page Testcases Writing Testcases

\verbatim
  - added tests/data/openSUSE-11.1 containing raw susetags metadata.
  Keeping .solv files in svn is somewhat inconvenient, as you must rebuild them
  if something in satsolver changes.
\endverbatim

\verbatim
  - added  tests/include as location for includes that might be used in multiple
  testcases.
\endverbatim

\verbatim
  - added tests/include/TestSetup.h to ease building a test environment below
  some tempdir. Currently supports easy setup of Target, RepoManager and
  loading data (raw metadata and .solv files) into the pool.

  That's how it currently looks like:

          #include "TestSetup.h"

          BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(WhatProvides)
          {
            TestSetup test( Arch_x86_64 );  // use x86_64 as system arch
            test.loadTarget(); // initialize and load target
            test.loadRepo( TESTS_SRC_DIR"/data/openSUSE-11.1" );

  This is all you need to setup Target, RepoManager below some temp directory
  and load the raw metadata into the pool.

  In case you want to setup the system below some fix directory, use:

          TestSetup test( "/tmp/mydir", Arch_x86_64 );

  You directory is used as it is and not removed at the end.
