installation_sources was a part of yast2-packagemanager.rpm but
unfortunately was not ported to libzypp in time. This package
provides the port. Libzypp may integrate it (and obsolete this
package) in the future.

Usage:
  installation_sources [options] -a url   Add source at given URL.
    -n name Name the source.
    -e  Enable source. This is the default.
    -d  Disable source.
    -f  Autorefresh source.
    -Y  Answer Yes to all checksum and signature questions.
  installation_sources -s       Show all available sources.
